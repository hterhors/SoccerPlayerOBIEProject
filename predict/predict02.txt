Grant Hanley.
Grant Campbell Hanley (born 20 November 1991) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a defender for Championship club Blackburn Rovers and the Scotland national team.
Early years.
Hanley was born in Dumfries, Scotland. He was involved at youth level with local club Queen of the South, Crewe Alexandra and with Rangers before he joined Blackburn Rovers as a 16-year-old in 2008.
Blackburn Rovers.
At Rovers, Hanley was captain of the under-18 team.
He was given his first team début for Blackburn by Sam Allardyce when starting in the Premier League 1–0 victory at Aston Villa on the final day of the season on 9 May 2010. Hanley committed his future when he signed a new five-year deal with Blackburn on 21 July 2010.
Five days after Allardyce's departure, on 18 December 2010 Hanley made his first appearance of season 2010–11 by new manager Steve Kean as a 67th-minute substitute for Phil Jones in a 1–1 Premier League draw at home to West Ham United. This marked the beginning of his first period of appearing in the first team with some regularity. He made his FA Cup début on 8 January 2011, against Queens Park Rangers in the third round in a 1–0 victory at Ewood Park. On 5 March 2011, Hanley scored his first goal for Rovers in a 3–2 defeat against Fulham at Craven Cottage. That was the last of his nine Blackburn first team appearances that season although he was to make his international debut at the end of the season. On 31 December 2011, he started and played the full 90 minutes alongside Christopher Samba and headed in the winning goal in the 80th minute after being punched by David De Gea in a 3–2 away win against Manchester United at Old Trafford. This win lifted Blackburn off the bottom of the table. On 14 January 2012, Hanley started and played the full 90 minutes alongside Gael Givet in a 3–1 win over Fulham at Ewood Park. On 14 April 2012, he started the Premier League fixture with Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium and suffered ankle ligament damage and subsequently had to leave the field at half-time for Argentine Mauro Formica, the game finished 3–0 to Swansea City. At the end of the 2011–12 season, Hanley made 28 appearances and scored 1 goal in all competitions for Rovers. Ever since the departure of star defender Christopher Samba, Hanley has received more opportunities to play for Blackburn. In April 2012, Hanley was linked with a move to Manchester United after manager Alex Ferguson praised his performance following a 2–0 loss, where he could follow former youngsters Phil Jones but manager Steve Kean insisted Hanley isn't for sale.
He will play the 2012–13 season in the Championship after the club was relegated to the Championship, ending 11 years stay in the Premier League. Hanley maintain his first team place in the center back and formed a partnership with Scott Dann despite a series of changing management. In a match against Leeds United on 1 September 2012, Hanley set up a goal for Rubén Rochina to score Blackburn's third goal in a match to keep both side a draw and two weeks on, he scored his first goal of the season in a 2–1 loss against Middlesbrough, in Kean's last game as manager. One month later, Hanley scored the only goal in the game in a 1–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Hanley then signed a five-year contract with the club.
After Dann left for Crystal Palace in January 2014, Hanley was appointed as the new captain of the club. Manager Gary Bowyer said, "We spoke the other day about it, a lot of people think he'll be a future captain of Scotland and we see him being the captain here. He has took to the job well second time around and I'm delighted for the captain that he has scored his first goal of the season."
International career.
Hanley has captained Scotland at under-19 level. On 17 November 2010, he played for Scotland under-21s when aged 18 in a 3–1 win against Northern Ireland at Firhill.
On 1 February 2011, Hanley was called up to the senior Scotland squad for the first time ahead of the game against Northern Ireland in the Nations Cup. He made his full international début as an 84th-minute substitute on 25 May 2011 coming on for Gary Caldwell against Wales in the Nations Cup in Dublin. Four days later his second full international was his first as a starter. He played against the Republic of Ireland in the final game of the 2011 Nations Cup, with the Republic of Ireland winning 1–0.
His third full international cap was his debut at home. This was a late substitute appearance in the 2–1 win against Denmark on 10 August 2011. His first Scotland goal was in his fifth full international when he opened the scoring in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier at home against Wales on 22 March 2013 at Hampden Park.
